<h1>Ling Zhou</h1>
<h2>Design Lead</h2>
<p>Brown&RISD '13 &middot; from Nanjing, China</p>
<p>Aside from leading the design team, I'm mostly involved in product design. Some of my favorite tasks are creating UI guidelines, rapid-prototyping, and workflow-optimization.</p>
<p>When I'm not at our hip soho office, I like to zip around in the city for good coffee and places to spend my afternoons making <a href="instagram.com/watercolorcastle">watercolor sketches</a>. I also love craft fairs, karaoke, camping and hottubs.  </p>

<h1>Rob Verdino</h1>
<h2>Design Strategist</h2> 
<p>RISD '14 &middot; from Stirline, New Jersey<br>(a.k.a. the woods)</p>
<p>At VV I do a bunch of visual design and illustration work. I have the most fun making icons, designing web pages, and drawing my co-workers.</p>
<p>When I'm not practicing bad posture at my desk, I'm usually fantasizing about garlic bread or contemplating life's big questions like " do solo cups ever get lonely?" I also like to embarrass myself in front of strangers through improv.</p>

<h2>Design Strategist</h2> 
<p>DCAD&Pratt '15 &middot; from Pennsylvania</p>
<p>I ideate and create for the Vaudeville team. We do a little bit of everything here, but most of the time you can find me wire-framing new experiences or bringing to life our clients' next big vision.</p>
<p>If I'm not sifting through my misnamed photoshop layers, I'm probably at a concert, cooking something unhealthy, or binge watching the next netflix original series.</p>

<p>During my spare time, I love hunting for good food, glaring for unique clothes and looking at the <a href="junhaozhu.com">billboards</a> on the big apple. Time to time, I love being a tech-geek, trying out new devices and stuff.</p>
