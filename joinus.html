<h2>Interested in joining us?</h2>
<h1>We're hiring visual design interns! </h1>
<p>Change starts with better ideas.  We're looking for folks who have 'em.  Vaudeville Ventures is an idea, brand and strategy consultancy that helps clients gain a deeper understanding of their customers, craft engaging stories to capture their attention, inspire their loyalty, and surprise and delight them. We team with clients to improve products and processes, drive scalable growth and sustainable change, and fix tough problems from the inside out. Vaudeville Ventures work with companies from giants (Comcast, Madison Square Garden, CBS, Sotheby's) to startups (Eleven James, Mogul, Selfie, Adverator)  with our unconventional blend of inspiration, excavation, and whatever-it-takes-ification.</p>
<br>
<h2>So, what does it take to be a design intern at VV?</h2>
<p>You don't have to be a graphic design major. In fact, we encourage you to learn different things at art schools more than just your major. You will be in good hands if you are:</p>
<p>Willing to learn, practice and repeat</p>
<p>Passionate about art and design (both classic and trendy stuff)</p>
<p>Familiar with photoshop, sketch and illustrator</p>
<br>
<h2>On any given day, you might:</h2>
<p>Execute creative concepts</p>
<p>Develop mood boards, sketches and design explorations</p>
<p>Create layouts and mock-ups from briefs</p>
<p>Design logotypes, logos and icons</p>
<p>Working on revisions from design team and departmental feedback</p>
<p>Working with our design team, you will gain visual design experience while learning different aspects of digital product design and strategic consulting. As an intern, you'll work side-by-side with our industry's brightest minds-receiving mentorship, training, and experience on real, live projects. We want you to grow and develop as a designer in the digital space. </p>
